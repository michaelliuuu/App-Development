Building an iOS app in Swift that allows users to enter the number of liters and the price of gas per liter, and calculates the total cost of the gas. The app also displays a graph showing the trend of the total cost of gas over time, with each calculation added as a new data point. The graph updates dynamically as the user continues to enter and calculate the cost of gas. Can be capped at a certain list size and will restart the graph if it does.
